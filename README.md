MNIST is a widely used dataset of handwritten digits that contains 60,000 handwritten digits for training a machine learning model and 10,000 handwritten digits for testing the model. It was introduced in 1998 and has become a standard benchmark for classification tasks. It is also called the “Hello, World” dataset as it’s very easy to use.
